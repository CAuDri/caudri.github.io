Waren wir nur drei teams?
- Ulm, Kit und DHBW?

After the initial idea in February in Ulm and months of tireless work, the first Cognitive Autonomous Driving Challenge took place in Stuttgart on October 7, 2023.
Hungry for a test of strength after exhausting years of online competition and the unfortunate end of the Carolo Cup in Braunschweig, the five teams from Aachen, Karlsruhe, Stuttgart, Ulm and Wolfsburg were now able to meet in person again and compete against each other with their autonomous model vehicles.

The second edition of the Cognitive Autonomous Driving Challenge took place on June 21-22, 2024, at DHBW Stuttgart's Faculty of Technology. Building on the success of last year's inaugural event, three university teams came together to compete with their autonomous model vehicles.

## Looking Forward

The success of the second CAuDri Challenge has further established this competition in the autonomous driving education landscape. We're already looking forward to next year's event and welcome interested teams to join us for the 2025 competition.

Teams interested in participating next year can join our [Discord server](/discord/) or contact us at [kontakt@caudri-challenge.de](mailto:kontakt@caudri-challenge.de) for more information.

At the Faculty of Technology at DHBW Stuttgart, a venue was found that offered space for a brand new competition track with all imaginable scenarios and a second test track for parallel last-minute fixes and tests.

## Acknowledgments

This event wouldn't have been possible without the dedication of many individuals and organizations:

- DHBW Stuttgart for hosting us in their Faculty of Technology
- All volunteers and referees who ensured smooth competition proceedings
- The participating teams and their supporting institutions
- Everyone who contributed to the refreshments and catering
- All spectators who came to support the teams

The success of the first CAuDri Challenge has set a strong foundation for future competitions. We look forward to seeing everyone again at the next event, where we'll continue pushing the boundaries of autonomous driving technology together!
