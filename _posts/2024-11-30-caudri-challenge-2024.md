The CAuDri Challenge 2024 took place on friday and saturday the 21. and 22. of Juli. Three teams from the south of Germany, namely the team KITCar from Karlsruhe, the Team Spatzenhirn from Ulm and the home team Smart Rollerz from Stuttgart. Building on the success of last year's inaugural event and even though we were less teams then last year, there was more time and space available this time. 

## The tracks

The main competition track was constructed on site from new material and moved to the front of the venue were better lighting made for brighter pictures but also caused challenges for the cars perception, which the teams had to overcome. The problem of direct sun light is well known withing the community. Where there is light there be shadows and more importantly here, reflections which can throw of the cars lane marking detection and cause it to see markings where there are none leading to cars going off-track.

## Looking Forward

The success of the second CAuDri Challenge has further established this competition in the autonomous driving education landscape. We're already looking forward to next year's event and welcome interested teams to join us for the 2025 competition.

Teams interested in participating next year can join our [Discord server](/discord/) or contact us at [kontakt@caudri-challenge.de](mailto:kontakt@caudri-challenge.de) for more information.

At the Faculty of Technology at DHBW Stuttgart, a venue was found that offered space for a brand new competition track with all imaginable scenarios and a second test track for parallel last-minute fixes and tests.

## Acknowledgments

This event wouldn't have been possible without the dedication of many individuals and organizations:

- DHBW Stuttgart for hosting us in their Faculty of Technology
- All volunteers and referees who ensured smooth competition proceedings
- The participating teams and their supporting institutions
- Everyone who contributed to the refreshments and catering, especially 
- All spectators who came to support the teams

The success of the first CAuDri Challenge has set a strong foundation for future competitions. We look forward to seeing everyone again at the next event, where we'll continue pushing the boundaries of autonomous driving technology together!
