On October 7, 2023, after the initial idea in February in Ulm and months of tireless work by the organizing team, the first **Cognitive Autonomous Driving Challenge** took place in Stuttgart.
Hungry for a test of strength after exhausting years of online competition and the unfortunate end of the Carolo Cup in Braunschweig, the five teams from Aachen, Karlsruhe, Stuttgart, Ulm and Wolfsburg were now able to meet in person again and compete against each other with their autonomous model vehicles.

In the new building of the Faculty of Technology at DHBW Stuttgart, a venue was found that offered space for a brand new competition track with all imaginable scenarios and a second test track for parallel last-minute fixes and tests.
The rules for the first CAuDri Challenge were largely adopted from the last Carolo Cup, but with some simplifications to reduce the effort for everyone.
The Basic and Master Cups were merged and the static disciplines were omitted.
The competition was also held on just one day.
After the teams arrived early, the test tracks were soon set up and vehicles were on the road.
Before the final round, each team was given the opportunity to do a test run on the competition track.
The referees were also instructed, for which alumni of the participating teams were hired.
