title: CAuDri-Challenge 2023
teaser: Student teams pushed the boundaries of autonomous driving at the inaugural CAuDri Challenge, where miniature self-driving cars went head-to-head in demanding test scenarios. Five teams showcased their engineering prowess through 1:10 scale vehicles, tackling challenges from basic navigation to complex tasks like interpreting traffic signs and maneuvering around obstacles.

From an initial idea sparked in Ulm this February to reality in Stuttgart - the first Cognitive Autonomous Driving Challenge (CAuDri) came to life on October 7, 2023. After years of online competitions and the conclusion of the Carolo Cup in Braunschweig, five teams from Aachen, Karlsruhe, Stuttgart, Ulm, and Wolfsburg finally had the chance to compete in person with their autonomous model vehicles.

The new building of the Faculty of Technology at DHBW Stuttgart proved to be an ideal venue, offering space for both the main competition track with its diverse scenarios and a separate test track for last-minute adjustments and testing.

Building on the legacy of the Carolo Cup, we streamlined the competition rules to create a more focused event. We combined the Basic and Master Cups and replaced the static disciplines with an opening presentation session where teams shared their innovations and development challenges. The entire competition was condensed into a single action-packed day.

### Agenda 
- 10:00 : Welcome & Opening
- 10:30 : Team Presentations
- 11:00 : Test Drives & Adjustments
- 12:30 : Lunch Break 
- 14:00 : Warm-up Runs
- 16:00 : Main Competition 
  - Freedrive Course
  - Obstacle Evasion Course
- 18:00 : Award Ceremony

The day began with teams arriving early to help set up the venue - a testament to the collaborative spirit of the competition. As test tracks came to life and vehicles took their first runs, volunteer referees (mostly alumni from various teams) were briefed on their sections of the track and the scoring rules. The lunch break offered a perfect opportunity for teams to share their latest technological approaches and innovations over pizza, fostering a friendly and inspiring atmosphere.
