## The CAuDri-Challenge
The CAuDri-Challenge aims to provide a community driven platform for students to develop their own autonomous model vehicles and compete in a series of driving challenges.
Each team designs and builds a 1:10 scale autonomous vehicle that is challenged to navigate complex rural and suburban scenarios, adhering to traffic rules, recognizing road signs, obeying speed limits, and maneuvering around obstacles.

Community is our core principle as we seek to connect inspired individuals and let them compete. This challenge is for the students by the students!

### Who is it for?
Everybody is welcome to participate, however most teams are organized at educational institutions e.g. universities or technical colleges in Europe. 
We do not have an age limit and currently do not require any certificate of enrollment. Feel free to take a look at our [regulations](/regulations/) for the official requirements.

### Some History
Many of the teams now competing at the CAuDri-Challenge previously participated in the Carolo-Cup, a similar student competition hosted by the *Fakultät für Elektrotechnik, Informationstechnik, Physik* at the *Technische Universität Braunschweig* for many years. 
Unfortunately, the Covid-19 pandemic made it impossible to host an in-person competition. After the last in-person Carolo-Cup took place in 2020, the event was held entirely online until it was discontinued in 2023. 

The Carolo-Cup was the motivation for many students to spend their little free time working on their vehicles. Without it, there was no real reason to continue. 
At a get-together at Ulm University in 2023, experiencing cooperation and competition with like-minded students once again - the idea to host our own competition formed, as we decided to take matters into our own hands.

## CAuDri e.V.
We are *CAuDri e.V.*, a registered non-profit organization based in Germany. The organization was founded in 2024 with the goal to host the annual CAuDri-Challenge.
In cooperation with our teams, partners and institutions, we can provide our participants with regulated tracks for testing, team areas, prices and a platform to compete against each other.
We also want to help new teams getting started by offering software and hardware resources to lower the entry barrier.
